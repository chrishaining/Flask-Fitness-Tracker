        <p>Not sure why you'd want to do this, but it was the first filter I thought of. I suppose this would be useful for hypothesis testing, e.g. comparing yoga==true versus yoga==false could help to disprove the hypothesis "Yoga is positively correlated
            with the number of steps"</p>
